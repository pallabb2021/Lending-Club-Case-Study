## Business-objective

We are assisting a consumer finance company in identifying key characteristics of applicants who are likely to default (fail to repay the loan) and those who are not, using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods. This company specializes in types of loans to customers. They receive applications and must decide whether to approve a loan based on the applicantâ€™s ability to repay, aiming to enhance their performance.

To achieve this, we will analyze past data to determine which types of applicants are likely to default and which are not, thereby simplifying the loan approval or rejection process. We will utilize two files: a CSV file containing historical loan data (loan.csv) and an XLSX file with relevant information about the data (Data_Dictionary.xlsx).
